module-whatis "Description: PyTorch is a GPU accelerated tensor computational framework with a Python front end. Functionality can be easily extended with common Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython. Automatic differentiation is done with a tape-based system at both a functional and neural network layer level. This functionality brings a high level of flexibility and speed as a deep learning framework and provides accelerated NumPy-like functionality."
